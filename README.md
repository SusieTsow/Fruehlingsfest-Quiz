# Fruehlingsfest Quiz

This is a project I created to practice my front-end development skills, which I gained while working as an intern at Valencia Kommunikation AG.

Fruehlingsfest Quiz is a Vue.js application designed to provide a fun and interactive quiz experience about the Fruehlingsfest festival.
